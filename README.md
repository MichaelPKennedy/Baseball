# Baseball
This project demonstrates connecting to a database and using complex SQL queries to generate data from the database to display on the site.
The getDataFromSQL function in database_functions.php makes a connection to the database using PDO and an associative array of values from the database is returned.
Those values are then echoed onto the site in table format to give the user an organized table of data on the baseball players in the database.
